Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution.\\n\\nThere are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.\", \"modified\": \"2020-10-18T01:52:25.316Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--2e34237d-8574-43f6-aace-ae2915de8597\"}, \"attack-pattern--c898c4b5-bf36-4e6e-a4ad-5b8c4c13e35b\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": true, \"created\": \"2020-09-17T12:51:40.845Z\", \"name\": \"VBA Stomping\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1564.007\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.(Citation: FireEye VBA stomp Feb 2020)\\n\\nMS Office documents with embedded VBA content store source code inside of module streams. Each module stream has a <code>PerformanceCache</code> that stores a separate compiled version of the VBA source code known as p-code. The p-code is executed when the MS Office version specified in the <code>_VBA_PROJECT</code> stream (which contains the version-dependent description of the VBA project) matches the version of the host MS Office application.(Citation: Evil Clippy May 2019)(Citation: Microsoft _VBA_PROJECT Stream)\\n\\nAn adversary may hide malicious VBA code by overwriting the VBA source code location with zero\\u2019s, benign code, or random bytes while leaving the previously compiled malicious p-code. Tools that scan for malicious VBA source code may be bypassed as the unwanted code is hidden in the compiled p-code. If the VBA source code is removed, some tools might even think that there are no macros present. If there is a version match between the <code>_VBA_PROJECT</code> stream and host MS Office application, the p-code will be executed, otherwise the benign VBA source code will be decompressed and recompiled to p-code, thus removing malicious p-code and potentially bypassing dynamic analysis.(Citation: Walmart Roberts Oct 2018)(Citation: FireEye VBA stomp Feb 2020)(Citation: pcodedmp Bontchev)\", \"modified\": \"2020-09-23T11:31:50.407Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--c898c4b5-bf36-4e6e-a4ad-5b8c4c13e35b\"}, \"attack-pattern--970a3432-3237-47ad-bcca-7d8cbb217736\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": true, \"created\": \"2020-03-09T13:48:55.078Z\", \"name\": \"PowerShell\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1059.001\", \"modified\": \"2020-06-24T13:51:22.360Z\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution.
