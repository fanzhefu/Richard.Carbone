Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for registry to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code at Service start.  Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under <code>HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services</code>. The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe,  [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), or [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075). Access to Registry keys is controlled through Access Control Lists and permissions. (Citation: Registry Key Security)\\n\\nIf the permissions for users and groups are not properly set and allow access to the Registry keys for a service, then adversaries can change the service binPath/ImagePath to point to a different executable under their control.

Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. \\n\\nThere are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific. \\n\\nMore sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel. \", \"modified\": \"2020-06-20T22:28:45.651Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--43e7dc91-05b2-474c-b9ac-2ed4fe101f4d\"}, \"attack-pattern--15dbf668-795c-41e6-8219-f0447c0e64ce\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2017-05-31T21:30:55.471Z\", \"name\": \"Permission Groups Discovery\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1069\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may attempt to find group and permission settings.

Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.\\n\\nAn adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)) or used to spawn a new process (i.e. [Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)). An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.(Citation: Pentestlab Token Manipulation)\\n\\nAny standard user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.\", \"modified\": \"2020-04-16T19:37:02.355Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--dcaa092b-7de9-4a21-977f-7fcb77e89c48\"}}}"
