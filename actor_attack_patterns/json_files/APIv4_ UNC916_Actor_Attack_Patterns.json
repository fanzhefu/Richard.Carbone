Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically requires being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.(Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)\\n\\nAdversaries may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. These mechanisms can also be abused to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as one with elevated permissions/privileges).\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--35dd844a-b219-4e2b-a6bb-efa9a75995a9\"}, \"attack-pattern--eb062747-2193-45de-8fa2-e62549c37ddf\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": true, \"created\": \"2020-02-11T18:23:26.059Z\", \"name\": \"Remote Desktop Protocol\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1021.001\", \"modified\": \"2020-02-25T19:23:34.204Z\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to log into a computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
