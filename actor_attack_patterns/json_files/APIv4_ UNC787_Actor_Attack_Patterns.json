When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database (.sdb). If so, the shim database uses hooking to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS. \\n\\nA list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer (sdbinst.exe) is kept in:\\n\\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\\\AppPatch\\\\sysmain.sdb</code> and\\n* <code>hklm\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows nt\\\\currentversion\\\\appcompatflags\\\\installedsdb</code>\\n\\nCustom databases are stored in:\\n\\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\\\AppPatch\\\\custom & %WINDIR%\\\\AppPatch\\\\AppPatch64\\\\Custom</code> and\\n* <code>hklm\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows nt\\\\currentversion\\\\appcompatflags\\\\custom</code>\\n\\nTo keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a shim. However, certain shims can be used to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) (UAC and RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data Execution Prevention (DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH), and intercept memory addresses (GetProcAddress).\\n\\nUtilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc. (Citation: FireEye Application Shimming) Shims can also be abused to establish persistence by continuously being invoked by affected programs.\", \"modified\": \"2020-05-04T19:05:30.140Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--42fe883a-21ea-4cfb-b94a-78b6476dcc83\"}, \"attack-pattern--b6301b64-ef57-4cce-bb0b-77026f14a8db\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2020-01-22T21:04:23.285Z\", \"name\": \"Event Triggered Execution\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1546\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.
