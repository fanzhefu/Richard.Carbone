Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information.\\n\\nThe following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on an information repository:\\n\\n* Policies, procedures, and standards\\n* Physical / logical network diagrams\\n* System architecture diagrams\\n* Technical system documentation\\n* Testing / development credentials\\n* Work / project schedules\\n* Source code snippets\\n* Links to network shares and other internal resources\\n\\nInformation stored in a repository may vary based on the specific instance or environment. Specific common information repositories include [Sharepoint](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/002), [Confluence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/001), and enterprise databases such as SQL Server.\", \"modified\": \"2020-10-12T12:16:55.085Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--d28ef391-8ed4-45dc-bc4a-2f43abf54416\"}, \"attack-pattern--c21d5a77-d422-4a69-acd7-2c53c1faa34b\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2017-05-31T21:31:10.728Z\", \"name\": \"Non-Application Layer Protocol\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1095\", \"modified\": \"2020-10-21T19:41:49.412Z\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may use a non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network.

The Windows command shell (<code>cmd.exe</code>) is the primary command prompt on Windows systems. The Windows command prompt can be used to control almost any aspect of a system, with various permission levels required for different subsets of commands. \\n\\nBatch files (ex: .bat or .cmd) also provide the shell with a list of sequential commands to run, as well as normal scripting operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of batch files include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems.\\n\\nAdversaries may leverage <code>cmd.exe</code> to execute various commands and payloads. Common uses include <code>cmd.exe /c</code> to execute a single command, or abusing <code>cmd.exe</code> interactively with input and output forwarded over a command and control channel.\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--d1fcf083-a721-4223-aedf-bf8960798d62\"}}}"
