Compromised infrastructure can help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact with high reputation or trusted sites. By using compromised infrastructure, adversaries may make it difficult to tie their actions back to them. Prior to targeting, adversaries may compromise the infrastructure of other adversaries.(Citation: NSA NCSC Turla OilRig)\", \"modified\": \"2020-10-22T18:03:23.937Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--7e3beebd-8bfe-4e7b-a892-e44ab06a75f9\"}, \"attack-pattern--53ac20cd-aca3-406e-9aa0-9fc7fdc60a5a\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2020-02-20T20:53:45.725Z\", \"name\": \"Archive Collected Data\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1560\", \"description\": \"An adversary may compress and/or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration.
