Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. (Citation: Trend Micro APT Attack Tools) Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion. Adversaries may chain together multiple proxies to further disguise the source of malicious traffic.\\n\\nAdversaries can also take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to proxy command and control traffic.\", \"modified\": \"2020-10-21T17:54:28.531Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--731f4f55-b6d0-41d1-a7a9-072a66389aea\"}, \"attack-pattern--e01be9c5-e763-4caf-aeb7-000b416aef67\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2017-12-14T16:46:06.044Z\", \"name\": \"Create Account\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1136\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to victim systems.

Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private.

This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.\\n\\nFor efficiency, may protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key.
