Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. \\n\\nThread Execution Hijacking is commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code or the path to a DLL. A handle to an existing victim process is first created with native Windows API calls such as <code>OpenThread</code>. At this point the process can be suspended then written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via <code>SuspendThread </code>, <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, <code>SetThreadContext</code>, then <code>ResumeThread</code> respectively.(Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)\\n\\nThis is very similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012) but targets an existing process rather than creating a process in a suspended state.  \\n\\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via Thread Execution Hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. \", \"modified\": \"2020-06-20T22:21:29.233Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--41d9846c-f6af-4302-a654-24bba2729bc6\"}, \"attack-pattern--bf176076-b789-408e-8cba-7275e81c0ada\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": true, \"created\": \"2020-03-16T15:48:33.882Z\", \"name\": \"Asymmetric Cryptography\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1573.002\", \"modified\": \"2020-03-30T00:37:16.593Z\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.
