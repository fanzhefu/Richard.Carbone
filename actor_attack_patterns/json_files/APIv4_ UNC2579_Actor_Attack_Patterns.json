All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry.

The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses.
