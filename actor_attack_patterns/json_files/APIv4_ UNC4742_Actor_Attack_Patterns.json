The Windows command prompt can be used to control almost any aspect of a system, with various permission levels required for different subsets of commands. \\n\\nBatch files (ex: .bat or .cmd) also provide the shell with a list of sequential commands to run, as well as normal scripting operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of batch files include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems.\\n\\nAdversaries may leverage <code>cmd.exe</code> to execute various commands and payloads. Common uses include <code>cmd.exe /c</code> to execute a single command, or abusing <code>cmd.exe</code> interactively with input and output forwarded over a command and control channel.\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--d1fcf083-a721-4223-aedf-bf8960798d62\"}, \"attack-pattern--355be19c-ffc9-46d5-8d50-d6a036c675b6\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2017-05-31T21:30:56.776Z\", \"name\": \"Application Layer Protocol\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1071\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.
