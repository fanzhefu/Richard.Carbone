The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.\\n\\nIn an enterprise environment, servers and workstations can be organized into domains. Domains provide centralized identity management, allowing users to login using one set of credentials across the entire network. If an adversary is able to obtain a set of valid domain credentials, they could login to many different machines using remote access protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP).(Citation: SSH Secure Shell)(Citation: TechNet Remote Desktop Services)\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--54a649ff-439a-41a4-9856-8d144a2551ba\"}, \"attack-pattern--c32f7008-9fea-41f7-8366-5eb9b74bd896\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2017-05-31T21:30:25.584Z\", \"name\": \"Query Registry\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1012\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, configuration, and installed software.\\n\\nThe Registry contains a significant amount of information about the operating system, configuration, software, and security.(Citation: Wikipedia Windows Registry) Information can easily be queried using the [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) utility, though other means to access the Registry exist.
