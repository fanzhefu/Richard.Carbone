This can result in significantly furthering an adversary's objective in cases where credentials gained from web browsers overlap with privileged accounts (e.g. domain administrator).\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--58a3e6aa-4453-4cc8-a51f-4befe80b31a8\"}, \"attack-pattern--aedfca76-3b30-4866-b2aa-0f1d7fd1e4b6\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2020-03-12T20:38:12.465Z\", \"name\": \"Hijack Execution Flow\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1574\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs.

Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.  \\n\\nProcess hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code. A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such as <code>CreateProcess</code>, which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread. At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such as <code>ZwUnmapViewOfSection</code> or <code>NtUnmapViewOfSection</code>  before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, <code>SetThreadContext</code>, then <code>ResumeThread</code> respectively.(Citation: Leitch Hollowing)(Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)\\n\\nThis is very similar to [Thread Local Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/005) but creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process.
