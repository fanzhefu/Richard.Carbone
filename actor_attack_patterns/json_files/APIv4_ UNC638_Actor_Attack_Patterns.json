The startup folder path for all users is <code>C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\StartUp</code>.\\n\\nThe following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:\\n\\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run</code>\\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\RunOnce</code>\\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run</code>\\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\RunOnce</code>\\n\\nRun keys may exist under multiple hives.(Citation: Microsoft Wow6432Node 2018)(Citation: Malwarebytes Wow6432Node 2016) The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\RunOnceEx</code> is also available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer. Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a dependency. (Citation: Microsoft RunOnceEx APR 2018) For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a \\\"Depend\\\" key with RunOnceEx: <code>reg add HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\RunOnceEx\\\\0001\\\\Depend /v 1 /d \\\"C:\\\\temp\\\\evil[.]dll\\\"</code> (Citation: Oddvar Moe RunOnceEx Mar 2018)\\n\\nThe following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:\\n\\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Explorer\\\\User Shell Folders</code>\\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Explorer\\\\Shell Folders</code>\\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Explorer\\\\Shell Folders</code>\\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Explorer\\\\User Shell Folders</code>\\n\\nThe following Registry keys can control automatic startup of services during boot:\\n\\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\RunServicesOnce</code>\\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\RunServicesOnce</code>\\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\RunServices</code>\\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\RunServices</code>\\n\\nUsing policy settings to specify startup programs creates corresponding values in either of two Registry keys:\\n\\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Policies\\\\Explorer\\\\Run</code>\\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Policies\\\\Explorer\\\\Run</code>\\n\\nThe Winlogon key controls actions that occur when a user logs on to a computer running Windows 7. Most of these actions are under the control of the operating system, but you can also add custom actions here. The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Winlogon\\\\Userinit</code> and <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Winlogon\\\\Shell</code> subkeys can automatically launch programs.\\n\\nPrograms listed in the load value of the registry key <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Windows</code> run when any user logs on.\\n\\nBy default, the multistring <code>BootExecute</code> value of the registry key <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Session Manager</code> is set to <code>autocheck autochk *</code>. This value causes Windows, at startup, to check the file-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been shut down abnormally. Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this registry value which will automatically launch at boot.\\n\\nAdversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.\", \"modified\": \"2020-08-03T16:30:26.918Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--9efb1ea7-c37b-4595-9640-b7680cd84279\"}, \"attack-pattern--8c32eb4d-805f-4fc5-bf60-c4d476c131b5\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2018-04-18T17:59:24.739Z\", \"name\": \"User Execution\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1204\", \"modified\": \"2020-03-11T14:55:56.315Z\", \"description\": \"An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.
