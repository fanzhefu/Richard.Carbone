If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors. \\n\\nAdversaries may use several methods to accomplish [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) such as checking for security monitoring tools (e.g., Sysinternals, Wireshark, etc.) or other system artifacts associated with analysis or virtualization. Adversaries may also check for legitimate user activity to help determine if it is in an analysis environment. Additional methods include use of sleep timers or loops within malware code to avoid operating within a temporary sandbox.(Citation: Unit 42 Pirpi July 2015)\\n\\n\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--82caa33e-d11a-433a-94ea-9b5a5fbef81d\"}, \"attack-pattern--b3d682b6-98f2-4fb0-aa3b-b4df007ca70a\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2017-05-31T21:30:32.662Z\", \"name\": \"Obfuscated Files or Information\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1027\", \"description\": \"Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit.

These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection.
