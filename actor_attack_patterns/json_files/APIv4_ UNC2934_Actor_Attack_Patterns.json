Many Linux and macOS versions come with SSH installed by default, although typically disabled until the user enables it. The SSH server can be configured to use standard password authentication or public-private keypairs in lieu of or in addition to a password. In this authentication scenario, the user\\u2019s public key must be in a special file on the computer running the server that lists which keypairs are allowed to login as that user.(Citation: SSH Secure Shell)\", \"modified\": \"2020-03-23T23:43:46.977Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--2db31dcd-54da-405d-acef-b9129b816ed6\"}, \"attack-pattern--edadea33-549c-4ed1-9783-8f5a5853cbdf\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2020-10-01T01:30:00.877Z\", \"name\": \"Develop Capabilities\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1587\", \"description\": \"Before compromising a victim, adversaries may build capabilities that can be used during targeting.
