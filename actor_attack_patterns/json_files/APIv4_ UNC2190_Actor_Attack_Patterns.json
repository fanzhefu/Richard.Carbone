Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. (Citation: Trend Micro APT Attack Tools) Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion. Adversaries may chain together multiple proxies to further disguise the source of malicious traffic.\\n\\nAdversaries can also take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to proxy command and control traffic.\", \"modified\": \"2020-10-21T17:54:28.531Z\", \"id\": \"attack-pattern--731f4f55-b6d0-41d1-a7a9-072a66389aea\"}, \"attack-pattern--354a7f88-63fb-41b5-a801-ce3b377b36f1\": {\"x_mitre_is_subtechnique\": false, \"created\": \"2017-05-31T21:31:04.307Z\", \"name\": \"System Information Discovery\", \"attack_pattern_identifier\": \"T1082\", \"modified\": \"2020-03-26T18:17:42.298Z\", \"description\": \"An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture.
