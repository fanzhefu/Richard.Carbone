Warning: this feature is still under development and has limitations. 
It is implemented within the nsock library and thus has no effect on the ping, 
port scanning and OS discovery phases of a scan. Only NSE and version scan 
benefit from this option so farâ€”other features may disclose your true address. 
SSL connections are not yet supported, nor is proxy-side DNS resolution 
(hostnames are always resolved by Nmap).
