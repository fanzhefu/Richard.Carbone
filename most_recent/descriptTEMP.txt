While UNC3661 has stolen data from victims and attempted to monetize it by extorting the compromised organization, they have also sometimes leaked the data for free. During their intrusions, UNC3661 has relied mainly on stolen credentials to access corporate VPN environments and several publicly available tools and utilities, as well as built-in operating system tools. UNC3661 has shown a tendency to install or use native web browsers on victim systems and use these browsers as a means of tool ingress, often doing web searches for tools needed for the current stage of their operation. They have also resorted to some attention-grabbing techniques, including public shaming, interacting with victims within the victim environment, and defacement attacks. In September 2022, an actor Mandiant assesses to be associated with original UNC3661 activity returned to conduct intrusions which followed the same model of leaking data from technology and video game companies for the purpose of notoriety.

While UNC3661 has stolen data from victims and attempted to monetize it by extorting the compromised organization, they have also sometimes leaked the data for free. During their intrusions, UNC3661 has relied mainly on stolen credentials to access corporate VPN environments and several publicly available tools and utilities, as well as built-in operating system tools. UNC3661 has shown a tendency to install or use native web browsers on victim systems and use these browsers as a means of tool ingress, often doing web searches for tools needed for the current stage of their operation. They have also resorted to some attention-grabbing techniques, including public shaming, interacting with victims within the victim environment, and defacement attacks. In September 2022, an actor Mandiant assesses to be associated with original UNC3661 activity returned to conduct intrusions which followed the same model of leaking data from technology and video game companies for the purpose of notoriety.
