APT10,"APT10 is a China-nexus cyber espionage actor that has successfully targeted public and private corporations in Japan, the United States, and Europe since at least 2009. While there is a dearth of information implicating specific actors or units, cohesive targeting and shared resources almost certainly indicate the actors carrying out this campaign are intimately connected and operating under the auspices of a single sponsor. On December 20, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against APT10 operators that exposed portions of the group's operating parameters and tied them to China's Ministry of State Security. Just prior to the indictment, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed APT10 continuing to engage in global operations. A post-indictment survey of the group suggests they entered a period of operational dormancy."
APT12,"APT12 is a cyber espionage group with a Chinese nexus. The team has been active since at least 2009 and has focused heavily on Taiwan and the United States. The group carries out political and military intelligence collection, targeting government organizations, think tanks, and the defense industrial base (DIB) in addition to carrying out economic espionage. Private corporations targeted by APT12 often belong to industrial sectors that correspond to the People's Republic of China's stated national priorities. Significantly, private companies have been targeted by the group in the midst of the mergers and acquisitions process to gain strategic intelligence to support negotiations."
APT14,"APT14 is a China-nexus cyber espionage actor that engages in cyber operations where the goal is data theft, with a possible focus on military and maritime equipment, operations, and policies. APT14 has targeted organizations headquartered in multiple countries, including the United States, the Philippines, and Bangladesh. Targeted industries include government, telecommunications, and construction and engineering. Historical APT14 activity against defense industrial base (DIB) companies developing satellite communication and encryption technology is consistent with larger PRC military modernization goals. Specifically, it could support the People's Liberation Army (PLA's) intentions to develop weaponry and improved command and control (C&C) capabilities. "
APT15,"APT15 is a China-nexus cyber espionage that typically employs well-developed spear-phishing e-mails against global targets in the trade, economic and financial, energy, and military sectors.

This group has targeted organizations headquartered in countries including the United States and the United Kingdom. The group has targeted a broad range of industries including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the defense industrial base (DIB), advanced materials, electronics, energy, food and beverage, media, and mining. We assess that this is a nation-state sponsored group located in China."
APT17,"APT17 (Tailgater) is a a cyber espionage group with a China nexus that has targeted organizations headquartered in countries including the United States, United Kingdom and Japan. We assess that the goal of some of APT17 (Tailgater) operations is to compromise entire supply chains, rather than targeting and stealing data relating to a specific technology. The group uses uses both phishing e-mail messages and strategic web compromises (SWCs) to compromise victim organizations. This group has also been observed leveraging zero-day exploits. Further, operators may also identify vulnerable web servers, either at victim organizations or to be used for strategic web compromises, and upload web shells to those servers in order to gain access. The group's use of zero-day vulnerabilities, novel intrusion methods, and multiple malware families highlights the operation's sophistication and flexibility. "
APT18,"APT18 (Wekby) is a cyber espionage group with a Chinese nexus that has been active since at least 2011 and associated with multiple high-profile intrusions. This group engages in cyber operations where the goal is data theft, including intellectual property theft of data and projects that make a particular organization competitive within its field. This group"
APT19,"APT19 (Codoso) is a Chinese cyber espionage group that Mandiant Threat Intelligence"
APT1,"APT1 refers to a distinct grouping of global cyber espionage activity with a nexus to China. Based on available data, we assess that this is a nation-state-sponsored group located in China. Specifically, we believe that APT1 is the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's 3rd Department, or Unit 61398. The activity is distinguished by the use of common infrastructure and tools and a clear intent to collect intelligence on a number of issues that may be of interest to the People's Republic of China (PRC)."
APT20,"APT20 (Twivy) is a suspected Chinese cyber espionage group that engages in cyber operations where the goal is data theft. APT20 conducts intellectual property theft but also appears interested in stealing data from or monitoring the activities of individuals with specific political interests. Based on available data, we assess that this is a freelancer group with some nation-state sponsorship located in China. APT20 has used the unique password string th3bug in POISON IVY variants. Targeted organizations span multiple industries, including construction and engineering, healthcare, and non-profit organizations, as well as defense industrial base (DIB) and chemical research and production companies. "
APT21,"APT21 is a China-nexus cyber espionage actor that engages in cyber operations where the goal is data theft, possibly focusing on data related to political, economic, and social policy and activities as opposed to Intellectual Property (IP) theft. We believe this is a freelancer group with some nation-state sponsorship located in China. APT21 targeting has focused on multiple foreign governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including government organizations in the United States. The targeting of foreign governments and NGOs is consistent with assessed cyber activities of security organizations within the People's Republic of China (PRC), most notably the Ministry of State Security (MSS). Overall, APT21 targets appear to be those entities that oppose China's political status quo. An analysis of APT21 techniques suggests that another of their focus areas is dissident groups that seek greater autonomy or independence from China, such as those from Tibet or Xinjiang, a province in northwest China heavily populated by the Turkic Uyghur ethnic minority, long oppressed by the PRC."
APT22,"APT22 is a Chinese cyber espionage group that frequently uses strategic web compromises to exploit targets of interest. APT22 actors have identified vulnerable public-facing web servers on victim networks and uploaded webshells to gain access to the victim network. APT22 has also used phishing emails to gain access to target networks, but these instances appear to be less common."
APT23,"APT23 is a China-nexus cyber espionage actor that has historically targeted organizations headquartered in the United States and the Philippines and industries including media and national government. APT23 typically stole information that contained political and military significance, rather than Intellectual Property (IP). The nature of known APT23 data theft, which is mainly focused on the emails of journalists working in China or on related topics and documents with military and political significance, suggests that the intent of APT23 intrusions might be to monitor opinions and activities related to regional territorial disputes. Of note, Mandiant Threat Intelligence has not observed APT23 activity since 2014."
APT24,"APT24 previously targeted a wide variety of industries, including organizations in the government, healthcare, construction and engineering, mining, nonprofit, and telecommunications industries. Given the apparently broad scope of their activity, assessing their specific objectives with certainty is difficult. Based on available data, we believe that this is a China-based, nation-state sponsored threat group. This group is known to have targeted organizations headquartered in countries including the United States and Taiwan. Data theft from this actor is mainly focused on documents with political significance, suggesting their intent is to monitor the positions of various nation states on issues applicable to China"

Mandiant Threat Intelligence has also identified ties between APT33 and wiper malware, suggesting that the group may also have destructive capabilities."
APT34,"APT34 is a cyber espionage group with a nexus to Iran that has been operational since at least 2014. We believe APT34 conducts operations largely focused on phishing efforts to benefit Iranian nation-state interests. This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and has largely focused its operations within the Middle East, but has targeted North American and European organizations. We assess that APT34 works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests."
APT36,"APT36 is a long-standing cyber espionage actor that conducts intelligence collection in support of Pakistani military and diplomatic interests. Active since at least 2013, APT36 intrusion campaigns reflect a concerted effort to target regional rival India, while also demonstrating an interest in targeting military and intergovernmental organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United Nations (UN) that have a stake in the region. In addition, APT36 has targeted multiple industries in nations outside of the region to include the U.S. APT36 typically employs spear phishing as a primary method of initial compromise, using malicious attachments that include Microsoft Windows executables and Microsoft Office Documents (that leverage macros and known exploits). This actor's phishing lures usually follow military and political themes. We have further observed these actors leverage a unique watering hole technique that employs social engineering (rather than web exploits) to entice victims to download and open malicious Microsoft Office documents."
APT37,"APT37 is a cyber espionage group that we assess carries out operations on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. APT37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sector primarily in South Korea. In 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean peninsula and to a wider range of industry verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and healthcare entities in terms of both geography and sector."
APT38,"APT38 is a financially motivated North Korean regime-backed group responsible for conducting destructive attacks against financial institutions, as well as some of the world's largest cyber heists.

APT3,"APT3 is a China nexus cyber espionage actor that has targeted a wide variety of verticals since at least 2010 in sophisticated campaigns that demonstrated exceptional operational security. Alleged members of APT3 were indicted by the U.S. Justice Department in November 2017. The indictment came several months after security researchers publicly accused specific individuals associated with the Guangzhou, China-based intelligence contractor Boyusec of being behind APT3 operations. The company disappeared after these revelations, and Mandiant has not identified subsequent APT3 activity. We assess that in this case, public exposure was the more relevant factor in curbing APT3 operations, but the subsequent indictment makes the actors even less likely to reappear in the coming years."
APT40,"APT40 is a Chinese cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2013 and has primarily focused on maritime targeting.

TEMP.Armageddon,"Mandiant Threat Intelligence has observed Russia-nexus TEMP.Armageddon's campaigns since at least 2013. We believe its primary objective is collecting information on Ukrainian national security and law enforcement entities in support of Russia's national interest and focuses exclusively on Ukrainian targets, with a particular interest in the ongoing eastern Ukraine conflict. We believe TEMP.Armageddon will almost certainly continue espionage operations against Ukrainian targets and further develop its technical capability. While TEMP.Armageddon's targeting thus far indicates it is a primary threat to entities in Ukraine, similar groups (such as Sandworm Team) that were initially regionally focused have also targeted entities outside the region. Any entity of potential interest to the Russian Government should be aware of TEMP.Armageddon."
Molerats,"Molerats (Gaza Cybergang) is a regionally-focused cyber espionage team concentrating campaign intrusion activities against diplomatic, financial, and political/military entities operating or with an interest in the Palestinian Territories. A combination of technical artifacts, targeting patterns, and social engineering themes leads us to believe Molerats has a Palestine nexus. The group appears to focus on information related to political and military issues affecting the Palestinian Territories and the wider Middle East region. This group has primarily targeted Ministries of Foreign Affairs, European missions to Palestine, Middle Eastern government entities, although they have also targeted the journalism sector, banks, and various think tanks."
Naikon Team,"Naikon Team is a regionally-focused cyber espionage actor concentrating on campaign intrusion activities against countries in South and Southeast Asia and entities with interest in the South China Sea region. The group has attempted to access networks associated with government, energy, communications, and media. Technical analysis demonstrates that Naikon Team employs a relatively large suite of malicious programs consisting of several pieces of malware. A combination of targeting, technical indicators, and actor attribution leads us to believe Naikon Team has a China nexus. The actor typically employs social engineering and open-source reporting, indicating an interest in military, government, and private industry in the region."
Roaming Tiger,"Roaming Tiger activity primarily focuses on targets in the former Soviet Union and Eastern European region. There is some indication that the group is not limited to that region, having possibly targeted Israel and the Central and East Asian region. Common tactics associated with Roaming Tiger include relatively well-known malware variants and capabilities to bypass traditional security control. Further, infrastructure analysis revealed a greater operational scope than originally thought, increasing the risk of targeting not only to aerospace, but also defense and diplomatic entities in the surrounding region. Moreover, associated domains with the group"

UNC2047,"UNC2047 is a financially motivated threat cluster that has been deploying the LEMONDUCK remote exploitation tool for cryptocurrency mining operations. Public reporting on LEMONDUCK, which we suspect is exclusive to the threat cluster, suggests that UNC2047 has been active since May 2019. UNC2047's targeting is almost certainly opportunistic given that LEMONDUCK is self-propagating. The malware is capable of spreading to other systems by scanning the Internet for vulnerable systems then using an exploit, guessing passwords, harvesting credentials for lateral movement, and infecting removable drives and network shares. Once LEMONDUCK has spread to a new system, it downloads additional code, such as cryptocurrency miner payloads."
UNC2053,"UNC2053 is a financially motivated cluster of activity that encompasses the use of various loader and backdoor combinations that are distinct but share a common networking protocol. Mandiant has regularly observed these campaigns incorporating new delivery tactics and it is plausible that UNC2053 relies on multiple partners for distribution. We have high confidence that common actors are behind the development of TrickBot and these families. UNC2053 appears to partner with multiple threat actors who leverage access obtained by UNC2053 to subsequently deploy ransomware."
